This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` callback.  The callback is triggered multiple times for a single barcode, causing unexpected behavior. This is particularly noticeable when scanning barcodes rapidly. The multiple triggers can lead to duplicate entries in the application's data, and potentially performance issues if not properly handled.
